**PowerBiMIP** is an open-source, efficient MATLAB toolbox for modeling and solving bilevel mixed-integer programming (BiMIP) problems, with a special focus on applications in power and energy systems.

## Overview

PowerBiMIP provides a user-friendly framework to formulate complex bilevel optimization problems involving both continuous and integer variables at both the upper and lower levels.

The toolbox currently supports:
* Bilevel Mixed-Integer Programs (BiMIP).
* Automatically converts user-input models into standard-form BiMIP, allowing users to focus on model construction.
* Automatically transforms BiMIP with coupling constraints into BiMIP without coupling constraints.
* Optimistic solution perspectives. (The pessimistic perspective is comming soon)
* Multiple solution methods, including exact mode and quick mode.

### Quick Start Example

Let's walk through a simple example to illustrate how to use PowerBiMIP. The following problem is defined in `examples/toy_examples/BiMIP_toy_example1.m`.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

* **Upper-Level Problem:**
    ```
    min_{x}  -x - 10*z
    s.t.
        x >= 0
        -25*x + 20*z <= 30
        x   + 2*z  <= 10
        2*x - z    <= 15
        2*x + 10*z >= 15
    ```

* **Lower-Level Problem:**
    Where `z` is determined by the solution of:
    ```
    min_{y,z}  z + 1000 * sum(y)
    s.t.
        -25*x + 20*z <= 30 + y(1)
        x   + 2*z  <= 10 + y(2)
        2*x - z    <= 15 + y(3)
        2*x + 10*z >= 15 - y(4)
        z >= 0
        y >= 0
    ```

**MATLAB Implementation:**

To ensure compatibility with the toolbox's internal matrix operations, please adhere to the following input specifications:
* **Variables**: All variable sets (`var_xu`, `var_zu`, `var_xl`, `var_zl`) passed to the solver must be formatted as N x 1 column vectors. You can use `reshape(var, [], 1)` to achieve this.
* **Constraints & Objectives**: The constraint sets and objective functions must be standard YALMIP objects.
* **Problem Type**: Currently, PowerBiMIP officially supports **Bilevel Mixed-Integer Linear Programs**. Support for quadratic terms is under development.

Here is the code to model and solve this problem using PowerBiMIP.

```matlab
% 1. Initialization
clear; close all; clc; yalmip('clear');

% 2. Variable Definition using YALMIP
model.var.x = intvar(1,1,'full'); % Upper-level integer variable
model.var.z = intvar(1,1,'full'); % Lower-level integer variable
model.var.y = sdpvar(4,1,'full'); % Lower-level continuous variables

% 3. Model Formulation
% --- Upper-Level Constraints ---
model.constraints_upper = [];
model.constraints_upper = model.constraints_upper + (model.var.x >= 0);
model.constraints_upper = model.constraints_upper + (-25 * model.var.x + 20 * model.var.z <= 30);
model.constraints_upper = model.constraints_upper + (model.var.x + 2 * model.var.z <= 10);
model.constraints_upper = model.constraints_upper + (2 * model.var.x - model.var.z <= 15);
model.constraints_upper = model.constraints_upper + (2 * model.var.x + 10 * model.var.z >= 15);

% --- Lower-Level Constraints ---
model.constraints_lower = [];
model.constraints_lower = model.constraints_lower + (-25 * model.var.x + 20 * model.var.z <= 30 + model.var.y(1,1) );
model.constraints_lower = model.constraints_lower + (model.var.x + 2 * model.var.z <= 10 + model.var.y(2,1) );
model.constraints_lower = model.constraints_lower + (2 * model.var.x - model.var.z <= 15 + model.var.y(3,1) );
model.constraints_lower = model.constraints_lower + (2 * model.var.x + 10 * model.var.z >= 15 - model.var.y(4,1) );
model.constraints_lower = model.constraints_lower + (model.var.z >= 0);
model.constraints_lower = model.constraints_lower + (model.var.y >= 0);

% --- Objective Functions ---
model.objective_upper = -model.var.x - 10 * model.var.z;
model.objective_lower = model.var.z + 1e3 * sum(model.var.y,'all');

% 4. Define Variable Sets for the Solver
model.var_xu = []; % Upper-level continuous variables
model.var_zu = [reshape(model.var.x, [], 1)]; % Upper-level integer variables
model.var_xl = [reshape(model.var.y, [], 1)]; % Lower-level continuous variables
model.var_zl = [reshape(model.var.z, [], 1)]; % Lower-level integer variables

% 5. Configure and Run the Solver
ops = BiMIPsettings( ...
    'perspective', 'optimistic', ...
    'method', 'exact_KKT', ...
    'solver', 'gurobi', ...
    'verbose', 2 ...
    );
[Solution, BiMIP_record] = solve_BiMIP(model.var, ...
    model.var_xu, model.var_zu, model.var_xl, model.var_zl, ...
    model.constraints_upper, model.constraints_lower, ...
    model.objective_upper, model.objective_lower, ops);
```
Running this script will solve the problem and return the optimal solution, which is $x = 2$, $z = 2$, with an upper-level objective of $-22$.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before installing PowerBiMIP, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1.  **MATLAB**: R2018a or newer.
2.  **YALMIP**: The latest version is highly recommended. You can download it from the [YALMIP GitHub repository](https://github.com/yalmip/YALMIP).
3.  **A MILP Solver**: At least one MILP solver is required. We strongly recommend **Gurobi** for its performance and robustness. Other supported solvers include CPLEX\COPT\MOSEK.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Download PowerBiMIP**: Clone or download the repository from [https://github.com/GreatTM/PowerBiMIP](https://github.com/GreatTM/PowerBiMIP).
2.  **Add to MATLAB Path**: Add the PowerBiMIP root folder and its subfolders to your MATLAB path. You can do this by running the following command in the MATLAB console from the PowerBiMIP root directory:
    ```matlab
    addpath(genpath(pwd));
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use the "Set Path" dialog in the MATLAB environment.
3.  **Verify Installation**: Run one of the toy examples to ensure that PowerBiMIP and all its dependencies are correctly configured.
    ```matlab
    run('examples/toy_examples/BiMIP_toy_example1.m');
    ```
