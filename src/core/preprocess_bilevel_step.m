function [model_out, ops_out] = preprocess_bilevel_step(model_in, ops_in)
%PREPROCESS_BILEVEL_STEP Performs a single transformation step in the model preprocessing pipeline.
%
%   Description:
%       This function is called by 'preprocess_bilevel_model' when a
%       coupled model is detected. It applies a single, appropriate
%       transformation based on the model's current perspective (e.g.,
%       pessimistic-to-optimistic or coupled-to-uncoupled).
%
%   Input:
%       model_in - struct: The coupled PowerBiMIP model structure to be transformed.
%       ops_in   - struct: A struct with solver options.
%
%   Output:
%       model_out - struct: The model after one transformation step.
%       ops_out   - struct: The updated options struct, which may have a
%                   modified .perspective field after transformation.

    % By default, options are passed through unchanged.
    ops_out = ops_in;
